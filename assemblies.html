        <h3>Citizens Assemblies: Bridging Divides through Deliberation</h3>
        <p>An innovative approach to facilitating meaningful intergroup contact involves "Citizens Assemblies." These assemblies convene representative citizens to deliberate on complex societal and political issues. Functioning as a form of political jury duty, Citizens Assemblies offer a platform for diverse groups to engage in constructive discourse. Through such deliberations, common ground can emerge, leading to actionable solutions.</p> 
        <p>A notable example is Ireland's utilization of Citizens Assemblies since 2016, resulting in policy recommendations that have influenced the nation's stance on climate change. Notably, a Citizens Assembly on Brexit demonstrated the potential to resolve the UK's departure from the European Union by finding a compromise among participants.</p>
